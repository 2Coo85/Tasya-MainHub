                    <h4>Background</h4>
                    <p>I first experienced coding in high school when we were introduced to the language C++. I liked the end product but not neccessarily all the work that went into it.</p>
                    <p>While studying in college, I found I excelled not only in math courses but in computer courses as well. Discovering this, I decided to study 3D Animation combining my love of animation with computers. While I enjoyed learning this skill, it still didn't quite fit.</p>
                    <p>Fast-forward some years, and my attention was brought to Web Development as a way to use my computer skills and get back to actual coding. Once exposed, I was hooked and look forward to helping people create their websites.</p>
